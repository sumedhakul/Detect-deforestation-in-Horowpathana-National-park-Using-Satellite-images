# Detect-deforestation-in-Horowpathana-National-park-Using-Satellite-images
Deforestation is a major concern in many parts of the world, including Sri Lanka. To effectively
address this issue and develop appropriate conservation strategies, it is crucial to accurately
detect and monitor deforestation. One approach to detect deforestation is through the use of
satellite imagery, specifically Landsat satellite images and the analysis of their Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index values. Therefore, this study is to detect the changes in forest
cover in Horupathana National Park during the period from 2020 to 2023 using ARIMA and
Random Forest models. According to the data validation, the Mean Absolute Error 0.297, Mean
Squared Error 0.154 and the R-squared Score: 0.9982. As a result, the forest cover decreased
to 18.864% compared to 2020 levels. Legal measures should be pursued by the relevant
authorities to address the escalating deforestation issue, and a comprehensive approach is
crucial to safeguard the diminishing forest resources within the research region.
